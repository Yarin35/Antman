# Antman
file compression and decompression

the algo used here is the dictionnary algorithm

it's done in c

⚠️ this algo only works on text and doesn't keep the architecture (indentations, tabs, spaces)

📋 Usage:
- make re
- ./Antman [file.txt] (choose here the text file to compress)
- you should see a compressed.txt (and a sentences has been displayed in the terminal 🙂)
- ./Giantman compressed.txt (to decompress the data)
- you now have a decompressed.txt that contains the same data as the [file.txt]
